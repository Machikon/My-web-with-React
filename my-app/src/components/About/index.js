        Machiko is an experienced accountant and a new full-stack web developer.
        Her passion for the web development is driven by her own experience in
        her accounting career. More and more businesses and organizations utilize
        their own websites to generate sales or to establish brands
        nationally or internationally. Front-end technologies have
        significant impacts on those sales and recognitions becasue of the client-side
        interactions and experiences. Additionally, many businesses are moving
        toward data-driven strategies to meet customer demands and to provide
        more enhanced services and goods. Machiko has made the first step to
        become a “modern professional,” who has a full understanding of the
        multiple key business functions for the new era of digitalization.
